# Arrays Explained

<img src="#" alt="JS Array Sample">

<p>An array is a group of related data elements saved in neighboring memory locations. 
This standard data structure contains every data element that can be entered as soon as possible by just using its index number. </p>

<p>For example, Angie can create an array as a shopping list for the grocery store. Angie can code it where she can make a variable for the array, followed by an assignment operator, and then the brackets with the array objects, apples, and cucumbers.

    const shopping list = ['apple', 'cucumbers'];
