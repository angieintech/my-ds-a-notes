<h1> Hash Tables </h1>

<h2>What is a hash table?</h2>

<p>A hash table is a data structure that utilizes a hash function to record data where it is placed in memory. 
   Every stored information component requires a name, also known as a key. For example, a key can be a different type of fruit, such as an apple. 
   Each fruit is paired with exactly one data piece, a value, such as fuji apple. It's easier to find the type of apple that an individual can look for because they know the fruit's key. Lastly, the hash function stores the key and the value. </p>
